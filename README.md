# 🏫 Huddle Room Reservation System | TU Science Complex

## Overview

This project modernizes the **Huddle Room reservation system** at Towson University’s Fisher College of Science and Mathematics. Previously managed via paper sign-up sheets, room reservations were inefficient, error-prone, and lacked proper access control. Our team designed and implemented a digital scheduling solution using **Microsoft Bookings**, integrated with **Crestron touch panels**, and built a **centralized landing page** to streamline student and faculty bookings.

## 🔧 Key Features

- 🟢🔴 **Crestron Panel Integration** for real-time room status updates  
- 🌐 **Landing Page** for role-based navigation (student vs faculty)  
- 🧾 **Flyer Design** with QR code for direct access  
- 🔒 Access control to ensure appropriate use of faculty vs. student rooms  
- ✅ Usability-tested interface with feedback-driven improvements  

## 📋 Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Bookings  
- Microsoft 365 / Outlook Integration
